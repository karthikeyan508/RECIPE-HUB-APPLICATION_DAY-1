         <h2>Cooking Tips</h2>
         <p>Get started by boiling 2 cups of water in a covered pot. When the water has reached a boil, add 1/4 teaspoon salt and 1 cup of white rice.<br/>
         Cover the pot and let it simmer for 18-20 minutes. As tempting as it may be, try not to stir or lift the lid while the rice is cooking.<br/>
         Once the rice looks as fluffy as can be, take it off the burner and let it sit for 5 minutes. This cooling process allows the rice to steam and become the soft — but not too soft — consistency that we all strive for.<br/>
         Add more texture to the rice by fluffing it with a fork. Before serving, top it off with 1/2 cup of chopped herbs (we love cilantro and parsley!).</p>
